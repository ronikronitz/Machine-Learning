# Wikipedia Award Winners Clustering
## Description
This project dives into the rich world of Wikipedia to explore and categorize pages dedicated to award-winning individuals across various fields. Utilizing sophisticated machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, our objective is to cluster Wikipedia pages in a way that reveals underlying patterns, similarities, and thematic groupings among these distinguished figures. By analyzing the textual content of pages related to award recipients, we aim to uncover insights into commonalities in their achievements, careers, and contributions. This clustering endeavor not only aids in the systematic organization of information but also enhances our understanding of the characteristics that link these winners, potentially shedding light on the pathways to excellence and recognition.
