# Wikipedia Award winners clustering
Project Overview
This project aims to explore text clustering techniques to uncover meaningful patterns within a vast dataset of textual content. Leveraging machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), we group similar texts to facilitate deeper analysis and insights. This README outlines the project's purpose, setup, usage, and contribution guidelines.

Got it, let's craft a comprehensive README for your GitHub project related to text clustering. Here's a structured template that you can customize based on your project specifics. Replace placeholders (text in <angle brackets>) with your project's details:

Features
TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts text documents into a machine-learning-friendly format.
Feature Selection: Implements methods like Variance Threshold and TruncatedSVD to refine features for clustering.
Clustering Algorithms: Uses K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering for grouping texts.
Evaluation Metrics: Employs Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Calinski-Harabasz Index for clustering effectiveness assessment.
